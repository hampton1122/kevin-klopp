title: Limiting security risks in telecom equipment
---

The head of the Federal Communications Commission is considering new rules that would effectively bar the use of telecommunications equipment from foreign suppliers who are deemed a threat to national security.

At the FCC's next public meeting Chairman Ajit Pai plans to propose rules that would bar money from the commission's $8.5 billion Universal Service Fund from going to U.S. telecommunications providers that buy equipment from companies that "pose a national security threat" to U.S. networks.

"Hidden 'back doors' to our networks in routers, switches -- and virtually any other type of telecommunications equipment -- can provide an avenue for hostile governments to inject viruses, launch denial-of-service attacks, steal data, and more," Pai said in a March 26 statement introducing the proposed rules. "Although the FCC alone can't safeguard the integrity of our communications supply chain, we must and will play our part in a government- and industry-wide effort to protect the security of our networks."
