Containers are a form of virtualization that allow for the deployment and execution of applications and their dependencies in isolated environments. Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package and distribute software, and they offer several advantages over traditional virtualization methods, such as virtual machines. They will often consist of an application and its dependencies, including libraries, configuration files, and runtime environment, packaged together in a single image. This image can be run on any host with a container runtime environment, such as Docker or Kubernetes, and provides the same environment and behavior regardless of the host. This makes containers highly portable and helps ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

Containers also provide a level of abstraction between the application and the underlying infrastructure, allowing applications to run on different hosts without modification. This enables organizations to adopt DevOps practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, and to rapidly deploy and scale applications.

Examples of IT container services include:

* Docker: The most widely used container platform, providing a platform for building, shipping, and running containers.

* Kubernetes: An open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

* Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): A fully managed container orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): A managed Kubernetes service offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

* Red Hat OpenShift: A container application platform that helps organizations develop, deploy, and manage applications in a containerized environment.

* VMware Tanzu: A portfolio of products and services for building, running, and managing modern applications on any infrastructure.

* Docker Swarm: A native container orchestration solution provided by Docker.
