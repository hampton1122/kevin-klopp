Your company has probably invested in several security tools to keep your sensitive data secure, but do you know whether these tools will actually prevent an attacker from gaining access? Our red team services can give you peace of mind by testing your company’s potential to respond to threats and breaches.

With red teaming, we’ll simulate an attack to test your controls, policies and security training. Along with testing front-end and back-end systems and networks, our services include trying to break into secure facilities to gain physical access to sensitive data. This may include dumpster diving, corporate phishing attempts and social engineering.

Employees are often the most susceptible point of entry for attackers. To make the simulation as real as possible, we will only brief key personnel in your company on our efforts. Through phone calls, email phishing and onsite assessments, we’ll determine whether your policies and controls are sufficient at keeping your sensitive data secure.

These services are in-depth and include the use of multiple tools and inspections. When we’ve finished the attack, we’ll provide you with a detailed report that shows where your company’s security is good and where it needs improvement.

Our team will:
* Customize our attacks to your specific security concerns
* Attempt to gain unauthorized access without detection
* Maintain access for a period of time to see whether your team identifies the threat how your team responds
* Produce a report to help you strengthen your security and prevent a real attack
