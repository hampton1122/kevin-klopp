Mobile apps face growing security risks with new vulnerabilities found every day. To make sure your customers and clients feel secure giving you their information, testing is crucial.

We perform deep-dive penetration testing on commercial, internally developed and outsourced apps using third party and open-source tools. Our analysis is custom to your app and includes testing of static, dynamic, server-side, data storage, privacy and permissions of Android and iOS apps. Our goal is to find flaws and vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data and help your developers fix these defects as quickly as possible.

Our approach focuses on:
* Application Design Review
* Threat Modeling
* Comprehensive Mobile Application Security Assessments
* Code Review
* Forensic Analysis
