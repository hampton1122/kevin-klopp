- name: "Sensitive Data Discovery Scan"
  description: "A sensitive data scan will locate social security numbers, credit card numbers, drivers licenses and any other defined data within your storage, whether hidden in an Excel spreadsheet on a desktop, or on your servers. The PCI DSS requirements apply to all of the components of the network containing cardholder data. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the entity knows where all sensitive data is transmitted and stored. HIPAA HITECH also holds requirements for sensitive patient records as well. Therefore, it is important to scan all of the networks to search for cardholder data that may be stored on desktops or back-end accounting systems. A 'Sensitive Data Scan' will find this highly sensitive data so that actions can be taken to contain and secure it. Impervious Solutions can include the scan in our proposals or you can provide evidence that the cardholder data is contained as described."
